# Authorized Minter

_As an authorized minter, I want to mint tokens for a token issuer at an agreed upon rate and sell the tokens at a profit, with royalties returning to the issuer._

You can act as an authorized minter for token issuers. When you do this, you own the NFToken, but it will show the issuer as the correct issuer and royalties should flow to them. When you make a sale of that NFT, the proceeds of the initial sale will go to you. You can have an agreement with your issuer to pay them all or some of that initial sale amount.

Account A assigns Account B as an Authorized Minter.

Account B mints a token, setting the Issuer as Account A.

Account B sells the token, and receives the proceeds.

Account A receives the royalties.

Account B agrees to transfer an agreed upon amount of the proceeds to Account A (be sure you trust the seller!).
